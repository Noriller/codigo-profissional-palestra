# Programmers Oath (The Coder's Code)

0. I will not produce harmful code.
  
   - I will not release a defect.
   - I will not make code for others harder to understand or change (soft-ware, easy to change).

1. The code that I produce will always be my best work.

   - I will not willingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.

2. I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.

   - Write tests.

3. I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.

4. I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve our work at every oportunity. 

   - I will never allow it to degrade.

5. I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible.

   - I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.
   - I will not damage the code, I will not make things worse.

6. I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.

7. I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision.

   - I will not make promises without certainty.

8. I will never stop learning and improving my craft.
