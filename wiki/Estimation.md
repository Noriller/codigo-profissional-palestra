# Estimates should be

- Honest. (The most honest is "I don't know." <= Not precise or useful.)
- Accurate.
- Precise.
- Useful.
- Should never be a date.
- Should be a range of dates.
- Best Case - 95% chance of missing.
- Worst Case - 5% chance of missing.
- Normal Case - 50% chance of missing.
- High cost to refine estimates.
- You have specialize knowledge. Knowledge of saying "no".
- "Can't you just try?" - "It's a insult because I'm trying, already doing whatever I can."
